Cab
===

Cab (named for the jazz bandleader and scat singer Cab Calloway) is a
Django application which allows users to post and share useful
"snippets" of code.

This code is used to power the snippet sharing site, djangosnippets.org


Installation notes
==================

Cab has a couple of external dependencies:

    * `Pygments`_ for code highlighting.

    * `python-markdown`_ for processing snippet descriptions. Other
      Python ports of Markdown will not work, since the code which
      calls Markdown assumes the existence of python-markdown's "safe
      mode".

    * `django-simple-ratings`_ for item ranking

    * `django-taggit`_ for tagging 

    * `django-haystack`_ for search

    * `django-amazon-resources`_ for recommended titles

Additionally, the default setup requires a few applications which are
bundled with Django itself:

    * ``django.contrib.comments`` to enable commenting.

    * ``django.contrib.markup`` to handle Markdown formatting of
       comments.

    * ``django.contrib.syndication`` to enable feeds.

It's also recommended that you have ``django.contrib.admin`` installed
for ease of site maintenance.

Once you've got those taken care of, grab a git checkout of Cab
from somewhere on your Python path::

    git clone git://github.com/coleifer/djangosnippets.org.git 

Then add ``cab`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting of your Django
project, run ``manage.py syncdb``, and either put a call to
``include('cab.urls')`` somewhere inn your root URLConf or copy over
the URL patterns from Cab that you want to use.

Note that the ``get_absolute_url`` methods of the ``Language``,
``Snippet`` and ``Tag`` models assume that they will live under the
URLs ``/languages/``, ``/snippets/`` and ``/tags/``, so if you want
them to go elsewhere you'll need to edit those methods or ovveride
them with Django's ``ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES`` setting.
